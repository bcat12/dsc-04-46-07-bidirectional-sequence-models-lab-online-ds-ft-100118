    "# Bidirectional Sequence Models - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll learn to make use of **_Bidirectional Models_** to better classify sequences of text!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and explain the basic architecture of a Bidirectional RNN. \n",
    "* Identify the types of problems Bidirectional approaches are best suited for. \n",
    "* Build and train Bidirectional RNN Models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we're going to use a **_Bidrectional LSTM Model_** to build a model that can identify toxic comments on social media. This dataset comes from the [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) in partnership with Google and Jigsaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "From the \"Data\" section of the Kaggle competition linked above:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* toxic\n",
    "* severe_toxic\n",
    "* obscene\n",
    "* threat\n",
    "* insult\n",
    "* identity_hate\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us a couple things about the problem, which will affect the overall architecture of our model. Although this may technically be a multiclass classification problem, in practice, our model will treat each comment as 6 concurrent instances of binary classification. This is because a toxic comment can fall into one or more of the categories listed above--for example, a  comment may be toxic, obscene, threatening, and insulting, all at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cell below to import everything we'll need for this lab. "
